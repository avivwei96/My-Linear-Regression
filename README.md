README file for MyLinearRegression model

## Overview

This is a simple implementation of a linear regression model in PyTorch, named `MyLinearRegression`. The model uses mean squared error (MSE) loss function and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer to learn the weights of the model.

## Requirements

The model requires the following dependencies:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyTorch 1.0 or higher
- tqdm 4.0 or higher

## Usage

To use the `MyLinearRegression` model, you can create an instance of the class and pass the input dimension to the constructor, as shown below:

```python
import torch
from MyLinearRegression import MyLinearRegression

input_dim = 2
model = MyLinearRegression(input_dim)
```

After creating the model instance, you can train the model on your data using the `train` method. The `train` method takes a PyTorch `DataLoader` and the number of epochs to train for as input arguments. Here is an example of how to train the model:

```python
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

# Create DataLoader object for your data
train_data = [[1, 2], [2, 4], [3, 6], [4, 8]]
train_targets = [3, 6, 9, 12]
train_dataset = [[torch.tensor(train_data[i], dtype=torch.float32), torch.tensor(train_targets[i], dtype=torch.float32)] for i in range(len(train_data))]
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=1)

# Train the model
n_epochs = 100
model.train(train_loader, n_epochs)
```

After training the model, you can use it to predict on new data using the `forward` method, as shown below:

```python
test_data = [[5, 10], [6, 12]]
test_data_tensor = torch.tensor(test_data, dtype=torch.float32)
predictions = model.forward(test_data_tensor)
```
